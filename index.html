        <div id="page1" class="page">
            <p>Dear Farah,</p>
            <p>I updated this page on 2023/09/10, Tomorrow's supposed to be our anniversaries for one year, but I understand we already made decision to be on our way each others,
                if you ever read this messages someday in the future, 
                I hope you want to read the messages until it finishes, 
                I guarantee I don't want to make you become baffle, confused, or anything... 
                and it's not about rekindling any moments between us in the past, 
                I just want apologize sincerely for entire my mistakes, 
                because I think when we met for the last time in the Delapan Padi (Bandung).. 
                I was so frozen, sudden death, 
                couldn't talk properly even I already knew that it was our last moment, 
                so that's why I made this </p> 
            <p>I hope this message finds you well. 
                I wanted to take a moment to express my sincerest apologies for the way things ended between us. 
                Looking back, I realize that I made mistakes and hurt you (the only person that truly cared about me), 
                and for that, I am truly sorry.</p>       
        </div>
        
        <div id="page2" class="page">
            <p>I want you to be happy, no matter what that means.. 
                I want you to find someone who will treat you with all the love you really deserve.. 
                I want you to meet someone who will see you always everyday with love, 
                take care of you with right, with everything, someone who will accompany you and you will be happy with him for entire your life, someone who is better, loving man, kind man that really is destined to accompany you till Jannah. 
                I believe there will be a right time & a right person from Allah for Farah.</p>
            <p>I realize that person is not me :( ........  
                it's so painful but I have to accept it, for the sake of your happiness and future</p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="page3" class="page">
            <p>Although we parted in such bitterness and contempt, I still want to say thank you for everything you taught me.
                In our past relationship, I realize lately that I was the problem itself, Farah already did too much by compromising & making a lot of efforts
                to me, since the first time we met in Bogor until the last time we met 
                (You did a lot of things & efforts, you're really kind woman that I ever met, 
                everytime I went to Jakarta.. you always picked me up, drove the car, invited me to new places,
                even you still spared your time in the middle of hectic).. Yes the problem was Zaqi,
                I was the one failed to adjust, validate, and understand you. It was not you, it was me.. 
                I was still immature 
            </p>
            <p>I realize it was my individual mistake, what you did by making closure of our past relationship
                on 19 June 2023, it was right decision...
            </p>
            <p> I deserved getting closure and rejection by you, after what I did to you on May 2023, I was such a fool actually.. 
                I couldn't become a good listener, validated your feelings that made you become uncomfortable at that time.. 
                when we met on 7th may in Borma, then you went to Jakarta.. there was an incident you fell off/slipped,
                and you still continued to drive three cities in just one day for looking for me on 9th may in Indomart Cisitu..
                I should realized at that time you must be tired physically mentally-drainage, even I failed to listen,
                assure, comfort, validate your well-being.. instead I gave you solution that even you didn't need at all... 
                Ohh I was so stupid actually.. then on 11th may, I made a big mistake.. you cried after what I did while we were having our last video call
                .. by saying about trauma or mental that even I was the stupid one should go to therapy, and also comparing with last relationship that I shouldn't never do :( 
            </p>
            <P>For entire my life, I could never forgive myself
                for what I did to you at that day. I have to live my consequences for what I did/say to you
            </P>
        </div>

        <div id="page4" class="page">
            <p>The incident on 11 May 2023 actually gave rise to two things if identified...
            </p>
            <p>1) Zaqi is traumatized by feeling guilty, 
                because it is 100% my fault and the cause of the closing is also because of Zaqi's words... 
                Farah is very kind and even still wants to meet Zaqi for the closing in Bandung
                where a strong heart is needed :(, I am really sorry about that
            </p>2) Farah was traumatized by feeling hurtful, 
            Zaqi's words also hurt Farah, 
            (Farah is a truly sincere person), 
            Zaqi stupidly downgraded Farah... 
            Zaqi wants to apologize once again sincerely through this journal... 
            Farah is really good, hidden gem , precious, 
            nothing wrong with you.. 
            the one wrong was me actually.. 
            Farah deserves to get a truly equal partner/"sekufu" in Islamic terms, 
            or even more (not like Zaqi who has low emotional intelligence), 
            with your gut, 
            logical thinking, 
            and pure heart I believe you will find that right person and compatible with you
            <p>
                You are worth it, what's wrong is Zaqi..... you really deserve better (that's real 100%)
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="page5" class="page">
            <p>It's not Farah's responsibilty to comfort Zaqi about feeling guilty & regret that Zaqi made in the past.
                but this is a form of Zaqi's efforts as a sincere apology for everything that has happened, 
                as well as praise and prayers for Farah in the future. 
                Zaqi is sure that Farah will get the best in the present and future.
            </p>
            <p>Zaqi got a real enlightenment and learned a lot from Farah
                "In a relationship, it's true that there are bad trauma wounds, ups & downs, 
            but that doesn't mean that ending the relationship is like win or lose... 
            but about win and learn, Zaqi here learn a lot about sincere & pure love from Farah, 
            how to become a good partner in the future. 
            Learn about what kind of behavior is good towards a partner, 
            Zaqi also lear a lot about using his mind and heart before speaking from Farah, 
            lear about how to speak better, which I know it is kind of I-statement & Assertive words (still working on it), 
            learn to enjoy the process while it is in progress, even enjoy the little moments.."
            </p>
            <p>
                Break up & closing were necessary after all, 
                'cause I was the one toxic, 
                avoidant partner, bad observer, disrespectful, 
                and emotionally unavailable.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="page6" class="page">
            <p>Although right now maybe it is already day zero when I am no one to you.. 
                I guess it has a silver line to you..</p>
            <p>You already made the right decision by ending our past relationship. 
                You did right thing, 
                it wasn't ego matter, but it was self-respect that I understand lately. 
                With that, Farah was kept away from a fate with the toxic person I used to be.
                By closing the relationship, 
                it will also open up the opportunity for Farah to meet someone who is really good, 
                sincere, responsible, 
                reliable, 
                has the same vision and mission principles, beliefs/values in the future as Farah, 
                and I'm sure there are people in Jakarta whose values will be in linear 
                and complement each other with Farah.
            </p>
            <p>Maybe this is Allah's way of indirectly getting Farah to find a partner who is really for Farah through good closings on June 19 2023, 
                maybe this is Allah's way of also warning Zaqi because there are still many bad things, 
                toxic traits, or red Zaqi's flags... 
                so that Zaqi is aware so that in the future he can be better.</p>

        <div id="page7" class="page">
            <p>I don't want to rekindle any past moments, 
                and I also am going to be genuinely happy to hear that you've found happiness with someone new. 
                Your happiness means a lot to me, 
                and I genuinely hope for the best for you in your new relationship.</p>
            <p>This letter is not about trying to change the past, 
                but rather about acknowledging my mistakes and expressing my remorse. 
                I've learned a lot from our time together, 
                and I am working on becoming a better person for myself and for those around me.</p>
            <p>P.S: I want to be like you that have a highly emotional intelligence, 
                that's why now I already joined some of treatments by professional help/therapist/psychology... 
                it's really life-changing, 
                step-by-step I'm able to understand myself better with my traits/toxic traits. 
                They taught me about emotional whell for identifying the human emotions, 
                mindfullness of current emotions: "letting go of emotional suffering", 
                and simple words but impactful that "memahami bahwa setiap tindakan ada alasannya".</p>
        </div>
    
        <div id="page8" class="page">
            <p>Once again, 
                I hope both of us can be happy and find each other happiness, 
                even though we are not together anymore.
                I hope you find someone who will have unconditional love for you, 
                You deserve it, humble person.</p>
                <P>I am sorry for any pain I may have caused you, 
                and I hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me. 
                Deep down in my heart, I am still regretting what I did to you... 
                No words can express my sorrow for the pain I've caused you, I beg your forgiveness..
                I always pray for the best for you, mom, dad, your family from long distace... your family's really kind to me, especially Ibu.. I wish you all the happiness and love in the world.</p>
            <p>Sincerely,</p>
            <p>Zaqi (Your incomplete love story)</p>
