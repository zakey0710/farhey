            <p>I update this page on 2023/09/10, if you ever read this messages someday in the future, I hope you want to read the messages until it finishes, I guarantee I don't want to make you become baffle, confused, or anything... and it's not about rekindling any moments between us in the past, I just want apologize sincerely for entire my mistakes, because I think when we met for the last time in the Delapan Padi (Bandung).. I was so frozen, sudden death, couldn't talk properly even I already knew that it was our last moment, so that's why I made this </p> 
            <p>I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to express my sincerest apologies for the way things ended between us. Looking back, I realize that I made mistakes and hurt you, and for that, I am truly sorry.</p>
